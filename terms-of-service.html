            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <em>Answerly</em> ("Answerly," "we," "us," "our"), an AI voice agent for medical clinics that answers calls, books appointments, and supports routine patient requests. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of answerlyvoice.com, our voice/telephony services, web app, APIs, and any related integrations (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a clinic or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity.</p>
            
            <div class="contact-info">
                <h3>Service Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Website:</strong> answerlyvoice.com</p>
                <p><strong>Owner/Operator:</strong> Answerly is owned and operated by Varyon Global.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>2. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted here and, where appropriate, notified in-product or by email. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
            <p>Some features require an account. You agree to (a) provide accurate, current, and complete information; (b) safeguard credentials; and (c) promptly notify us of any unauthorized use. You are responsible for all activities under your account.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Service Description & Important Limitations</h2>
            <p><em>Answerly</em> is an automated AI voice agent that handles inbound/outbound calls for clinics, checks schedules, answers FAQs, and books appointments. It is not a substitute for professional clinical judgment and must not be used for medical triage or emergencies. The Service does not route 911/999/112 or other emergency calls. Clinics must clearly communicate emergency instructions to patients and maintain human escalation paths.</p>
            
            <p>We continuously improve the Service and may add or modify features at our discretion. We use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize disruption.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Healthcare & HIPAA (U.S. Clinics)</h2>
            <p>If your clinic is a HIPAA Covered Entity/Business Associate and uses Answerly to handle PHI, Varyon Global will sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) upon request and apply administrative, physical, and technical safeguards appropriate for handling PHI. We will follow HIPAA breach-notification obligations where applicable. Our product is positioned as HIPAA-compliant for medical clinics.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Privacy, Data Roles & Compliance</h2>
            <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by Varyon Global's Privacy Policy (which explains PDPL/GDPR compliance, controller/processor roles, security, retention, and international transfers). When Answerly processes clinic data (e.g., calls, transcripts, bookings) under your instructions, we act as processor to your clinic (controller). For our own site analytics, billing, fraud prevention, and service operations, Varyon may act as controller.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the Service in violation of law (including healthcare, privacy, or telemarketing laws),</li>
                <li>Upload or transmit malicious code, interfere with the Service, or attempt to bypass security,</li>
                <li>Use the Service to provide medical advice or to handle emergencies,</li>
                <li>Infringe or misuse others' data or intellectual property.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We may suspend or terminate access immediately for suspected violations or risks to security/operations.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Recording & Call Transparency</h2>
            <p>Depending on your configuration and local law, Answerly may record calls and generate transcripts to deliver the Service (e.g., booking, documentation, quality assurance). You are responsible for enabling any required call-recording notices/consents to callers and for configuring retention consistent with your obligations.</p>
            
            <h2>9. AI Behavior, Human Oversight & Accuracy</h2>
            <p>The Service uses automated reasoning and speech technologies. While we design for high reliability, AI outputs may be incomplete or incorrect. Clinics must maintain appropriate human oversight (e.g., escalation rules, quality checks) and remain responsible for clinical decisions, scheduling policies, and outbound communications triggered by the Service.</p>
            
            <h2>10. Third-Party Services & Integrations</h2>
            <p>The Service may integrate with third-party telephony, hosting, scheduling/EHR, messaging, analytics, or payment services. We do not control third-party services and are not responsible for their content, security, or availability. Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms and policies.</p>
            
            <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Service (including software, models, designs, documentation, and content) is owned by Varyon Global and its licensors. Except as expressly permitted, you may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works based on the Service. You grant us a non-exclusive license to process customer data as necessary to provide and maintain the Service.</p>
            
            <h2>12. Fees, Billing & Taxes</h2>
            <p>Some features are offered on a paid subscription basis. Prices (e.g., monthly subscription) are shown on the site and may change from time to time; we will notify you of material price changes prior to renewal. Subscriptions auto-renew unless canceled before the end of the current term. Unless stated otherwise by law or in an order form, fees are non-refundable once the billing period starts. You are responsible for applicable taxes.</p>
            
            <h2>13. Trials, Betas & Fair Use</h2>
            <p>We may offer trials, demos, or beta features. These are provided as-is, may be limited or withdrawn at any time, and may have additional usage caps. We reserve the right to enforce fair-use limits (e.g., excessive concurrent calls, abnormal traffic) to protect platform stability.</p>
            
            <h2>14. Service Availability & Support</h2>
            <p>We aim for high availability and timely support; however, the Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation. Clinics should maintain contingency workflows for downtime or connectivity issues.</p>
            
            <h2>15. Security</h2>
            <p>We employ defense-in-depth measures aligned with Varyon Global's ISO-style information-security controls, including encryption in transit/at rest, access controls, monitoring, and regular testing. You are responsible for securing your endpoints, credentials, network, and third-party accounts you connect.</p>
            
            <h2>16. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>Each party may access the other's confidential information. The receiving party will protect it with at least the same degree of care it uses for its own confidential information and not disclose it to third parties except to provide the Service or as required by law.</p>
            
            <h2>17. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
            <p>Call recordings, transcripts, and related logs are retained only as necessary to deliver the Service, comply with law, or follow clinic-configured retention settings, after which they are deleted or anonymized. Account and billing records may be retained per legal and accounting requirements.</p>
            
            <h2>18. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Service does not provide medical advice and is not a medical device. You are solely responsible for clinical decisions and emergency protocols.</p>
            
            <h2>19. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Varyon Global, its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, and affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages (including loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, data, or business interruption), even if advised of the possibility. Our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Service shall not exceed the amounts paid by you to us for the Service in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
            
            <h2>20. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Varyon Global and its affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from: (a) your breach of these Terms; (b) your misuse of the Service; (c) your violation of law (including healthcare and privacy laws) or third-party rights; or (d) disputes between you and your customers/patients.</p>
            
            <h2>21. Suspension & Termination</h2>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Service immediately if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms, present a security or legal risk, or fail to pay fees when due. You may terminate at any time by canceling your subscription; termination does not relieve you of accrued payment obligations. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases, and we will handle your data per Section 17.</p>
            
            <h2>22. Export & Sanctions</h2>
            <p>You must comply with applicable export controls and sanctions laws and may not use the Service if you are subject to restrictions.</p>
            
            <h2>23. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt (without regard to conflict-of-law rules). You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Cairo Economic Courts, unless Varyon Global elects another competent venue.</p>
            
            <h2>24. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence</h2>
            <p>These Terms, together with any order form and our Privacy Policy, are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service. In case of conflict between an executed order/DPA/BAA and these Terms, the executed document prevails for the conflicting subject matter.</p>
